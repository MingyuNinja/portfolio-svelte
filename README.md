# Personal Portfolio Project

This personal portfolio project is built using Svelte and Tailwind CSS. It showcases my personal experiences, projects, and technologies I am familiar with. 

## Inspiration

This page's design is a linear interpolation of [Brittany Chiang's](https://brittanychiang.com/) and [qewer33's page](https://qewer.dev/). Much of the inspiration for the layout, styles, and functionality were drawn from these excellent portfolios.

## Project Structure

The project consists of several components including:

1. **Home**: This is the landing page of the portfolio. It introduces myself and provides links to my social accounts on GitHub and Reddit.

2. **Projects**: This section displays a list of my projects. Each project has an image and a description. You can click on a project to visit its dedicated URL.

3. **Experiences**: This section displays a list of my work experiences. For each experience, I've mentioned the duration, a brief about the role, and the technologies used. If available, a URL is provided to explore more about the experience or the associated company/role.

4. **Interactive Spline Design**: An interactive 3D design created using the Spline tool is embedded in the portfolio.

## Hosting

The portfolio is intended to be hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Build

The application can be built using the following command:

```
npm run build
```

This command will create a `public` directory which contains the files ready to be served.
